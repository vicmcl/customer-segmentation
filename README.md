# Customer Segmentation Project using K-Means Clustering

### Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their demographic, behavioral, and transactional data using K-Means clustering technique. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups with similar characteristics, preferences, and behaviors, enabling targeted marketing, improved customer experience, and increased revenue.

### Data Description

The dataset used for this project consists of [insert number] customer records, each with the following features:

* **Demographic features**: age, gender, occupation, income, education level
* **Behavioral features**: purchase frequency, average order value, product categories
* **Transactional features**: total spend, last purchase date, purchase channel

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and scaled to ensure consistency and comparability across features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features were created by aggregating and transforming existing features to capture more nuanced customer characteristics.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: The dataset was clustered using K-Means algorithm with [insert number] clusters. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method and Silhouette analysis.
4. **Cluster Profiling**: Each cluster was profiled based on demographic, behavioral, and transactional characteristics to identify distinct customer segments.

### Results

The K-Means clustering algorithm identified [insert number] distinct customer segments, each with unique characteristics:

#### Segment 1: Young Professionals

* High-income, urban, tech-savvy individuals who frequently purchase online.

#### Segment 2: Family-Oriented

* Middle-aged, suburban, family-oriented customers who prioritize value and convenience.

#### Segment 3: Budget-Conscious

* Price-sensitive customers who prioritize discounts and promotions.

#### Segment 4: Loyalists

* Long-term customers who exhibit high loyalty and retention rates.

### Insights and Recommendations

* **Targeted Marketing**: Develop targeted marketing campaigns tailored to each segment's preferences and behaviors.
* **Personalization**: Offer personalized product recommendations and promotions based on individual customer characteristics.
* **Customer Retention**: Implement loyalty programs and retention strategies to maintain high-value customers.
* **Product Development**: Develop products and services that cater to the needs and preferences of each segment.

### Data Drift Analysis

To assess the stability of the customer segments and the need for model retraining, a data drift analysis was conducted. The analysis revealed:

* **Drift Detection**: A significant drift was detected in the data, indicating that the customer segments are not stable over time.
* **Drift Quantification**: The drift was quantified using metrics such as [insert metrics, e.g., KL-divergence, JS-divergence].
* **Retraining Frequency**: Based on the drift analysis, it is recommended to retrain the model every [insert frequency, e.g., 3 months] to ensure that the customer segments remain accurate and up-to-date.

### Technical Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* **Scikit-learn library** for K-Means clustering
* **Pandas and NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for data visualization

### Future Work

* **Segmentation Refining**: Refine the segmentation model by incorporating additional data sources (e.g., social media, customer feedback).
* **Segment Evolution**: Analyze the evolution of customer segments over time to identify trends and opportunities.
* **Segment-Specific Strategies**: Develop and implement segment-specific marketing, sales, and customer service strategies.
